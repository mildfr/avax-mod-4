# Degen Gaming

In this project, our goal is to create a custom token for "DEGEN GAMING" using the ERC-20 standard within the Remix IDE. This token will come equipped with several essential functions such as mint, burn, transfer, and redeem. These functions will allow us to manage the token's supply, facilitate transfers, and enable users to exchange the token for certain benefits.


## Description

We've successfully developed and deployed custom tokens for DEGEN GAMING using the ERC-20 standard. The project is currently hosted on the localhost network, with testing carried out on the Avalanche testnet using the provided faucet. Within this system, the owner holds the privilege to mint new tokens and also redeem them for valuable in-game rewards such as gun skins. For further inquiries and a comprehensive guide on how to perform these actions, please refer to the MetaCrafters website, where you'll find detailed instructions and assistance for a seamless experience. Start enjoying the benefits of DEGEN GAMING's token ecosystem today!
